# Ivan Lopez Portfolio

This portfolio is a final project for the Intro to Web Development Class at Portland State University. The personal portfolio is meant to showcase and highlight my professional experience and was meant to feature a navbar, about section, previous work (experience), projects, and a contact section.

The portfolio consists of three main program files (index.html, portfolio.css, and portfolio.js) that handle functionality of the website. The website can be run by executing the index.html file.

I did use class material as well as resources from w3school.com to help with the creation of the website.
