          <p> 
            Hello! I am Ivan Lopez. I am currently a student at Portland State University, 
            where I am majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Electrical Engineering 
            and Mathematics.
           
            My current professional interests include seeking to further learn and apply 
            skills related to Web Development, Machine Learning, and Software Engineering.  
          </p>

            Volunteering

          <p> 
            Outside of school, I do enjoy helping out in the community. I have primarily 
            been helping the 'SHPE: Leading Hispanics in STEM' Chapter at PSU, where we have
            been able to provide different events, opportunities, and conferences for students
            to take advantage of. SHPE has been instrumental to laying a foundation for myself
            and other students, and I wish to continue this for future students.

            Intersection Scale Model:
          </h2>
          <p> 
            The Scale Model was a 3-person group class project for ECE 102 aimed at simulating
            a 4-way intersection. For this project, we utilized the Labjack microcontroller interfaced
            with MATLAB. I was personally in charge of handling the software functionality, which consisted of several
            digital I/O on the controller, inputs on buttons for the pedestrian indicator, and the intersection lights.

          <p> 
            The ChocAn System was a 6-person group project for CS300. The purpose of the project
            was to create a data-processing system to help individuals with chocolate addiction.
            We followed proper software engineering proceedures and created requirements, design, 
            testing, and report plans to help throughout the process. I was personally responsible
            of programming the generation of reports created for the manager and provider users, which
            ranged from weekly users, costs, and services provided.
